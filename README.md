# Spring Boot 3 with Swagger, Reactive Web, and Project Loom (Java 21)

This project is a Spring Boot 3 application that leverages **Java 21** and **Project Loom** for enhanced concurrency, **Swagger** for API documentation, and **Spring WebFlux** for reactive web support.

## Features

- **Spring Boot 3**: The latest version of Spring Boot designed to work with Java 17+.
- **Swagger UI**: Automatically generated API documentation for the REST API using Swagger/OpenAPI.
- **Reactive Web**: Built using Spring WebFlux for handling asynchronous and non-blocking requests.
- **Project Loom**: Leveraging Project Loom features for lightweight, user-mode threads (fibers) to improve scalability and concurrency.

## Prerequisites

- **Java 21** (or higher) â€” includes features from **Project Loom** (early access features).
- **Maven** or **Gradle** (for project management and building).
- **IDE**: IntelliJ IDEA, Eclipse, or any other IDE supporting Java 21 and Loom.

## Setup

1. Clone the repository:

    ```bash
    git clone [<repository_url>](https://github.com/PalanivelLakshmi/BookStore.git)
    cd backend/bookstore
    ```

2. Open the project in your preferred IDE or editor.

3. Build the application:

    - With Gradle:

        ```bash
        gradle build
        ```

4. Run the application:

    - With Gradle:

        ```bash
        gradle bootRun
        ```

The application should now be running at `http://localhost:9090`.
